                </p>
                <p>
                    Stick around, Willy is going to tell you a bit about himself and how you can work together. With
                    Willy on your team, he’ll get your website up with modern functionalities, optimized and responsive
                    for mobile; along with a new coat of paint that’ll bring an increase in traffic with new business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the years, Willy has spent his time learning from minds such as Mosh Hamedani from Udemy and
                    Brad Traversy from YouTube. Willy has taken a plethora of tutorials from various sites including
                    freeCodeCamp.org and LearnCode.academy. With the 2hr+ commute to and from work, he also supplements
                    his learning from podcasts such as the Syntax Podcast with Wes Bos & Scott Tolinski and the .NET
                    Rocks podcast with Carl Franklin & Richard Campbell. Willy is also involved with the Palm Beach
                    Tech communities’ monthly meetups. It helps him stay consistent and continuously growing with
                    like-minded people who love to code. This consistent education has taught Willy Front End and Back
                    End languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, ASP.Net, and C#.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When building projects for businesses, it’s important to have multiple perspectives to better build
                    the project. So, listening to Ted Talks and to various interviews from entrepreneurs and CEO’s
                    helps to frame his mind into certain business needs he wouldn’t have thought of otherwise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the fast-paced evolution of technology, an additional way Willy believes he can stay up to
                    speed is by actively pursuing certifications. His goals are to receive the HTML, CSS, and
                    JavaScript Certifications from w3schools.com and acquire the Microsoft Certified Solutions
                    Associate: Web Applications from Microsoft.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Willy has been influenced by technology from a very young age. This has cultivated a tremendous
                    passion for technology which led him to go to college for Computer Networking. This transported him
                    into the world of coding or “Sudoku”. Willy's love for music through playing the bass guitar has
                    assisted him in bringing some creativity over into his logical coding world. Above all else, he
                    also believes one way to keep his life balanced is by incorporating spirituality into his Sunday
                    events. He keeps himself grounded by spending time with his family and friends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Willy looks forward to working with you. He hopes to help bring solutions to the shortcomings you
                    may be experiencing on your website and to see the increase in traffic you’ve been looking for!
